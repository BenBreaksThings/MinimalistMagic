# Minimalist Magic

## Purpose
If reading the card explains the card, reading the card should be as easy as possible for such a complex game. Minimize noise, minimize text, minimize everything possible without altering a 1:1 representation of the card functionality/costs/triggers.

## Philosophy
- No set symbols
- No flavor text
- With multiple printings, if there is a more concise way to convey information, prioritize most concise
  - Less used keywords may retain explanation to reduce confusion at table
- No collector data
  - Proxies are harder to print with copyright or text that resembles copyright material, easier to exclude it
  - This will be the most divisive design choice for the set, artist name is part of the collector data, see below section for more in depth explanation
- Where technically feasible within the capabilities of CardConjurer, all cards in 7th Edition style, personal preference
  - Some cards cannot be supported with provided templates, those will be created as needed in modern templates if possible
  - Example: CardConjurer template supports Planeswalkers up to 4 abilities, Urza Planeswalker has 5, it cannot be made with a singular cohesive style for each ability


## Design Choices
Wanted to make the proxies feel like one large set all created at the same time. To that end, style choices consist of:  

- Borders:
  - 7th Edition card style where able  
- Art:
  - Select recognizable, ideally classic art of a given card from Scryfall
  - Run chosen art through ChatGPT with a repeatable prompt to generate a black on white image with an artistic theme of comic inking  
- Set Symbols:
  - Never included, this is not a WotC product, it is not meant to map to a given printing/release/set, there is no need to replicate that mechanism  
- Collector Data:
  - This includes set id (e.g., "FDN" for Foundations), set number (e.g., 001/500), and artist name
  - While meant to resemble one large cohesive set, it was not "designed" at the outset to be a certain collection of cards, and the volume of cards made may ebb and flow over time
  - The set id shorthand would correlate to a set symbol, neither of which lend any value to the minimalist ideals of the project
  - Artist omission more clearly discussed in folllowing section



## No Artist Info Expanded Rationale
Limited socializing of this project early on, this was clearly the topic that people had the biggest and most polarizing opinion on. The rationale:
- At its inception, WotC choce to attribute art to an artist on each card, as someone in a family of many people who are and have been through their entire adult lives professional artists, I suppose and applaud WotC for that choice. That is however a choice they made for a commercially viable product that they sell, and this is not commercially viable, nor using the artists original works.
- I did pop into the MPCFill Discord server and socialize the project a while back and their proposed solution to get this added to their site would be to attribute the artist and the AI used to generate the art for every single card. This would add a lot of text to every card, a measure of distraction that the project is inherently trying to minimize. Elected to stay true to the project, not adapt, and not try to be hosted on the site - expecting that to be the critical feedback immediately received. 
- Some artists have come out and said that derivations of their art, specifically those made with AI are no longer their art. The AI may have made changes to the art that would not align with their artist choices, maybe have introduced things, removed things, effectively attributing to the artist may instead be a negative representation of the artist, whereas due to the AI manipulation of the art, they would be completely unaware of the derivation.
